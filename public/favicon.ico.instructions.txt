# Favicon Instructions

This file is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.

The actual favicon.ico will be generated dynamically by the /api/favicon route.
You can also generate a static version by:

1. Visit your deployed site at /api/favicon
2. Save the image
3. Place it in the public directory as favicon.ico
